# VS Code Settings

Simply copy-paste the settings onto your VS Code user settings (JSON) and it should change everything into something more convenient (you will probably need to install some extensions to get *everything* working though).

Do **not** bother about the comments in the `settings.json` file, VS Code can parse them.

There are also some *Shortcut Settings* included, you can also copy-paste them and it should work. In order to find where to copy-paste them, type <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>, insert `shortcuts` on the search bar, and then look for the JSON version of the Key Bindings.

I've included some settings for *Font Ligatures*, but they are currently only working on Macs (I think). You can find more information about the specific font I used (Fira Code) [here][fira_code].
