# VS Code

Simply copy-paste the settings onto your VS Code user settings (JSON) and it should change everything into something more convenient.

Do **not** bother about the comments in the `settings.json` file, VS Code can parse them.

There are also some Shortcut Settings included, you can also copy-paste them and it should work. In order to find where to copy-paste them, type `Ctrl + Shift + P`, type `shortcuts` on the search bar, and then look for the JSON version of the Key Bindings.

I've included some settings for *font ligatures*, but they are currently only working on Macs (I think). You can find more information about the specific font I used (Fira Code) [here](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode).
