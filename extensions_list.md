# List of Nice VS Code Extensions to Install

- [Intellicode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioExptTeam.vscodeintellicode)
  - This extension uses the power of AI to learn how people code on Github and then give you back suggestions of how to fill yours.
- [Code Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner)
  - Run various languages's files through one engine and usually one shortcut. Very cool if you're using a not so customized environment.
  - Doesn't have that great support for changing environment variables.
- [One Dark Pro](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zhuangtongfa.Material-theme)
  - In my humble opinion, the best theme ever for coding. It's dark, and doesn't have that big a contrast, which makes it easy on the eyes.
  - It became incredibly popular with the rise of the [Atom Editor](https://atom.io/) (which was debunked by VS Code).
- [Material Icon Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme)
  - A cool alternative is [vscode-icons](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscode-icons-team.vscode-icons). This icon theme goes very well with VS Code's standard dark theme.
- [SQL Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-mssql.mssql)
  - An extension created by Microsoft themselves to manage MSSQL databases directly through the editor.
  - There is also a specific editor that apparently uses VS Code's design that was also created by Microsoft: [Azure Data Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/azure-data-studio/download?view=sql-server-2017)
- [SQLTools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mtxr.sqltools)
  - This very cool extension lets you manage all of them database types through in one go. Simply amazing.
